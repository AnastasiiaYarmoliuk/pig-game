## 🧩 How to Play

- Two players take turns.
- On each turn, a player:
  - Rolls the dice as many times as they like.
  - Each roll adds to their **current score**.
  - But if they roll a **1**, their current score is lost and it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to **Hold** to add the current score to their total and end their turn.
- The first to reach **100 points** wins!
